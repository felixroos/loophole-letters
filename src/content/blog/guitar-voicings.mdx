This is a guitar fretboard:

import { Fretboard } from "../../components/guitar/Fretboard";

<Fretboard />

- It has 6 strings that are tuned to the notes E2, A2, D3, G3, B3, E4 from lowest to highest.
- As midi numbers, these are 40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64
- To change the pitch of a single string, you can press it down at one of the frets.
- Each fret adds one semitone to the strings base note, so if you press fret 2 on the low E string, you get E2 + 2 semitones = F#2.

## Fretboard Coordinates

Structurally, the fretboard of a guitar can be modeled as a 2d grid, where each fret is identified with a x:y position. Some examples:

- 0:0 = E2, 1:0 = E2+1 = F2, 2:0 = E2+2 = F#3 ....
- 0:1 = A2, 1:1= A#2, 2:1 = G2 ....
- 0:2 = D3, 1:2= D#3, 2:2 = G2 ....

colorized freboard, to see which pitches are the same?

To translate these coordinates, we can write a little function:

```js
let fretmidi = [40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64];
let fret2midi = (x, y) => frets[y] + x;

fret2midi(0, 0); // 40 = E2
fret2midi(1, 0); // 41 = F2
fret2midi(0, 1); // 45 = A2
fret2midi(1, 1); // 46 = A#2
```

## A more concise "Fretcode"

If we want to express a chord, we could invent a little code.
For example, we could write `---433` to express the coordinates **4**:3 **3**:4 **3**:5.

- In this notation, each character represents one string.
- A `-` means that the string should not be played.
- A `0` means the string should be played open.
- Any other number is just the x position of the string.

Again, we can write a little function to parse this fretcode into notes (midi numbers):

```js
let fretmidi = [40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64];
let fret2midi = (x, y) => frets[y] + x;

function fretcode2midi(fretcode) {
  let midi = [];
  frecode.split("").forEach((fret, y) => {
    if (fret === "-") {
      return; // skip if "-"
    }
    const x = parseInt(fret, 16);
    midi.push(fret2midi(x, y));
  });
  return midi;
}

fretcode2midi("---433"); // [B3, D4, G4]
```
