- reading flok-next branch (10.08.2023)

- https://github.com/munshkr/flok#readme
  - Strudel is not on the README.md list (low hanging PR..)
  - Node 14 recommended might be out of date
  - install: ran `npm install -g flok-repl flok-web` then `flok-web`: works fine!
  - multiple strudel instances don't work without workaround...
  - tried connecting to my local server from another computer, but it seemed the ip did not work :-/ likely a problem with my network
- running `npm i` worked, `Lerna (powered by Nx)` caught my eye..
- uses npm workspaces, entry package is `web`, let's see `web/package.json`
  - `codemirror` 6! + `react-codemirror` (like strudel)
  - contains `strudel` + `hydra-synth` + `p5`
  - has its own scoped packages under `@flok-editor/*`
  - bundle / dev with `vite`
  - frontend: `react` + `radix-ui` + `class-variance-authority` (?) + `cmdk` + `lucide-react` (icons) + `tailwind-merge` (?) + `tailwindcss`
  - backend: `express` + `commander` + `yjs` + `ws`
- entry file is `./bin/flok-web.js`
  - wires up `commander` cli options and calls `startServer` of `server.js`
- `./server.js`:
  - creates a vite server via `./vite-express.js`, probably using [vites js api](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html)
  - the vite server is wrapped in `withFlokServer` of `@flok-editor/server-middleware`, which seems to wire the yjs server side
  - the rest is probably just default

## questions

- why is it needed to use a custom vite server? 
  - why not use a default vite server for dev / just a static file server for prod + use a separate server for the networking?


look at `@flok-editor/*`
