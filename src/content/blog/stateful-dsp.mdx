import { WorkletSimple } from "../../components/worklets/WorkletSimple";

In my last 3 posts, I've started to learn how to do DSP on the web:

1. [Making Music with Buffers](https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/buffers/): Pregenerated Buffers
2. [Real Time Synthesis](https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/real-time-synthesis/): Naively Chaining Buffers
3. [Real Time Synthesis pt 2](https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/real-time-synthesis2/): Using AudioWorklets

So far, the actual DSP was completely stateless, as every sample was calculated only based on the current sample number `t`:

<WorkletSimple
  value={`{
let seq = (items, dur) => items[Math.floor(t/dur/44100)%items.length]
return 110*seq([1,1.5,2,2.5,3],.0625)*t/44100%1/2
}`}
  rows={4}
  client:only
/>

This is very charming but also limited.
