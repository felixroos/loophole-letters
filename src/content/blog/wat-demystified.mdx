The function header is pretty easy to digest:

```
func $saw (export "saw") (type $t0) (param $p0 f64) (param $p1 f64) (result f64)
```

We see that `t` is now called `$p0` and `f` is now called `$p1`.
Let's just focus on the calculation:

```
(f64.mul
  (f64.add
    (f64.copysign
      (f64.sub
        (local.tee $p0
          (f64.mul
            (local.get $p1)
            (local.get $p0)))
        (f64.trunc
          (local.get $p0)))
      (local.get $p0))
    (f64.const -0x1p-1 (;=-0.5;)))
  (f64.const 0x1p+1 (;=2;)))
```

.. and replace all `local.get $X` with our original variable names + remove all f64. prefixes + write out the consts:

```
(mul
  (add
    (copysign
      (sub
        (local.tee t
          (mul
            f
            t))
        (trunc
          t))
      t)
    -0.5)
  2)
```

Let's write it in one line:

```
(mul (add (copysign (sub (local.tee t (mul f t)) (trunc t)) t) -0.5) 2)
```

We see the following instructions being used here:

- [mul](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Multiplication)
- [add](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Addition)
- [sub](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Subtraction)
- [copysign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Copy_sign)
- [local.tee](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Variables/Local_tee)
- [trunc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Truncate_float_to_int)

Following the parens, we could make out an order of execution:

Now let's try to convert the prefix notation `(mul a b)` to infix notation `a * b`:

```
((copysign ((local.tee t (f * t)) - t) t) - 0.5) * 2.0
```

Now I'm not sure how to simplify that further, because `local.tee` and `copysign` are not arithmetic operations,
but rather do something with the stack.

In a more imperative way, the order of instructions is:

```sh
(f * t)
local.tee t _ # t = f*t
_ - t # (f*t) - t
copysign _ t
_ - 0.5
_ * 2.0
```

The "\_" stands for the result of the last operation.

Let's compare that with our AssemblyScript version:

```
((copysign ((local.tee t (f * t)) - t) t) - 0.5) * 2.0
(((f * t) % 1.0)                          - 0.5) * 2.0
```

This suggests that these two lines are equal:

```
(copysign ((local.tee t (f * t)) - t) t)
((f * t) % 1.0)
```
