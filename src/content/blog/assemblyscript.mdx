import { AssemblyScript } from "../../components/asc/AssemblyScript.jsx";
import { JsEval } from "../../components/lua/JsEval.jsx";

After [running Lua on the Web](/lua-wasmoon/), let's try a faster alternative: [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

While lua scripts are interpreted by a wasm program, AssemblyScript programs directly compile to wasm, which should make them significantly faster.

## Compilation

After some tinkering, reading [the compiler docs](https://www.assemblyscript.org/compiler.html) + taking some bits from [javascriptmusic](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/javascriptmusic/blob/d9aa076a02fc3506665c16b88676f51e44d7549d/wasmaudioworklet/synth1/browsercompilerwebworker.js#L142) (which btw inspired this whole idea), I've found this function to compile AssemblyScript code:

```js
import asc from "assemblyscript/asc";

async function compileAssemblyScript(code) {
  const output = Object.create({
    stdout: asc.createMemoryStream(),
    stderr: asc.createMemoryStream(),
  });
  const sources = {
    "index.ts": code,
  };
  const { error } = await asc.main(
    ["--outFile", "binary", "--textFile", "text", "index.ts"],
    {
      stdout: output.stdout,
      stderr: output.stderr,
      readFile: (name) => (sources.hasOwnProperty(name) ? sources[name] : null),
      writeFile: (name, contents) => (output[name] = contents),
      listFiles: () => [],
    }
  );
  if (error) {
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }
  return output;
}
```

The above function outputs an object with a `.binary`, where the web assembly binary is located as a buffer.
We can instantiate that using the browser method

```js
const output = await compileAssemblyScript(`
function fib(n: i32): i32 {
  if(n<2) {
    return 1;
  }
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
export function main(): i32 {
  return fib(36)
}
`);
const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiate(output.binary, {});
const main = wasm.instance.exports.main;
console.log(main()); // 24157817
```

With this knowledge, creating an AssemblyScript REPL is possible:

<AssemblyScript
  client:only
  value={`
function fib(n: i32): i32 {
  if(n<2) {
    return 1;
  }
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
export function main(): i32 {
  return fib(40)
}
`}
  rows={12}
/>

This seems to run quite fast!

## Versus JavaScript

Let's compare it to the JavaScript:

<JsEval
  client:load
  value={`
function fib(n) {
  if(n<2) return 1
  return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
}
fib(40)
`}
  rows={8}
/>

Not really surprising, but still great to see that AssemblyScript is faster!
For lower values of n, it's slower, but that is only because the compilation takes a bit of time.
The actual script execution is way faster.

And yes, of course there are faster fibonacci implementations, but that's not the point:

<AssemblyScript
  client:only
  value={`
export function fib(n: i32): i32 {
  var a = 0, b = 1
  if (n > 0) {
    while (--n) {
      let t = a + b
      a = b
      b = t
    }
    return b
  }
  return a
}
export function main(): i32 {
  return fib(40)
}
`}
  rows={12}
/>

I am eager to try out writing DSP with AssemblyScript, which should pair nicely with AudioWorklet,
to create faster-than-javascript performance!
Thanks to [Peter Salomonsen's javascriptmusic](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/javascriptmusic) for inspiring the idea.
