This is level 3 of my DSP journey. Previous Levels: [1](https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/dsp-lvl1/), [2](https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/dsp-lvl2/), [3](https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/dsp-lvl3/)

## Phase Problems

In the last levels, the oscillators were pure functions, just taking the time as input.
Most of the time, this will lead to phasing problems sooner or later.

This can be observed in the following example:

export let brokenphase = `
let freqs = [110,165]
let dsp = (t) => sin(seq(freqs,4,t), t)/4
//
let seq = (items, speed, t) => items[Math.floor(t*speed)%items.length]
let sin = (x, t) => Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * t * x)
`;

<Doughbeat rows={8} client:load value={brokenphase} client:load rows={5} />

Here, we have a simple 2 note melody that often crackles when the pitch changes.
If you pay close attention to the waveform, you can sometimes see vertical lines..

To see that better, let's plot the first 500ms as a static image:

<SamplePlot client:only code={brokenphase} />

Here we can clearly a vertical line on the note transition!
This vertical line will cause the speaker to move very fast, producing a crackle.

But why does this happen? To answer that, let's look at the two pitches as separate plots.
This is 110Hz (left half):

<SamplePlot
  client:only
  code={`
let sin = (x, t) => Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * t * x)
let dsp = (t) => sin(110,t)/4`}
  options={{ color: "green" }}
/>

... and this is 165Hz (right half):

<SamplePlot
  client:only
  code={`
let sin = (x, t) => Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * t * x)
let dsp = (t) => sin(165,t)/4`}
  options={{ color: "red" }}
/>

Our dsp function effectively switches between those waves: 110Hz for the first and 165Hz for the second half.
Because both waves are aligned to the left, a change in frequency might cause a value jump.

## Remembering the Phase

We can fix this problem by keeping track of the phase, using state:

export let fixedphase = `let st = 1/44100;
let phasor = (fn, incr) => (f1 = 1, phase = 0) => (f = f1) => {
    let out = fn(phase);
    phase += incr(f);
    return out;
}
let { PI, sin: SIN } = Math;
let sin = phasor(SIN, (f) => 2*PI * f * st)
let sqr = phasor(p=>p%1>.5?1:-1, (f) => f * st)
let saw = phasor(p=>(p%1-0.5)*2, (f) => f * st)
//
let freqs = [110,165], c1 = sin();
let dsp = (t) => c1(seq(freqs,4,t))/4
let seq = (items, speed, t) => items[Math.floor(t*speed)%items.length]
`;

<Doughbeat rows={8} client:load value={fixedphase} client:load rows={12} />

Now, the first 500ms look like this:

<SamplePlot client:only code={fixedphase} />

That looks and sound much better!

This also fixes the problem from level 1, where frequency modulation behaved not as expected:

<Doughbeat
  rows={8}
  client:load
  value={`let st = 1/44100;
let phasor = (fn, incr) => (f1 = 1, phase = 0) => (f = f1) => {
    let out = fn(phase);
    phase += incr(f);
    return out;
}
let { PI, sin: SIN } = Math;
let sin = phasor(SIN, (f) => 2*PI * f * st)
let sqr = phasor(p=>p%1>.5?1:-1, (f) => f * st)
let saw = phasor(p=>(p%1-0.5)*2, (f) => f * st)
//
let c1 = sin(), c2 = sin();
let dsp = t => {
  let fm = ((c2(4)+1)/2*.1+.9);
  let f = 110 * fm;
  return c1(f)/5;
}
`}
  client:load
  rows={12}
/>

Which also unlocks FM sounds:

<Doughbeat
  rows={8}
  client:load
  value={`
let st = 1/44100;
let phasor = (fn, incr) => (f1 = 1, phase = 0) => (f = f1) => {
    let out = fn(phase);
    phase += incr(f);
    return out;
}
let { PI, sin: SIN } = Math;
let sin = phasor(SIN, (f) => 2*PI * f * st)
let sqr = phasor(p=>p%1>.5?1:-1, (f) => f * st)
let saw = phasor(p=>(p%1-0.5)*2, (f) => f * st)
let c1 = sqr(), c2 = sin();
let dsp = (t) => c1(110 * c2(54) * 8) / 12;
`}
  client:load
  rows={12}
/>

## Waveshape

Trick from zzfx

<Doughbeat
  rows={8}
  client:load
  value={`
let dsp = t => {
  let osc = saw(110,t);
  let curve = 5;
  return Math.sign(osc)*Math.abs(osc)**curve / 8
}
let saw = (x,t) => ((x * t % 1) - 0.5) * 2`}
  client:load
  rows={12}
/>

alternative:

```js
function perc(x, c, t) {
  let ts = (t * x) % 1;
  return 0.5 - (ts * c) / (ts * c + 1);
}
```

wavepot Moog Filter (breaks for higher cutoffs...)

<Doughbeat
  rows={8}
  client:load
  value={`let bassline = [55,66,110,220];
let lp = Moog();
let dsp = (t) => {
  let freq = seq(bassline, 4, t)
  let synth = saw(freq, t)
  let cutoff = (-saw(4,t)+1)*700
  synth = lp(cutoff, .5, synth)
  return synth/6;
}
let seq = (items, speed, t) => items[Math.floor(t*speed)%items.length]
let saw = (x, t) => ((x * t % 1) - 0.5) * 2
function Moog(){
  var y1, y2, y3, y4, oldx, oldy1, oldy2, oldy3;
  y1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = oldx = oldy1 = oldy2 = oldy3 = 0;
  var p, k, t1, t2, r, x;
  return function(cutoff, res, input){
    cutoff = 2 * cutoff / sampleRate;
    p = cutoff * (1.8 - (0.8 * cutoff));
    k = 2 * Math.sin(cutoff * Math.PI * 0.5) - 1;
    t1 = (1 - p) * 1.386249;
    t2 = 12 + t1 * t1;
    r = res * (t2 + 6 * t1) / (t2 - 6 * t1);
    x = input - r * y4;
    // four cascaded one-pole filters (bilinear transform)
    y1 =  x * p + oldx  * p - k * y1;
    y2 = y1 * p + oldy1 * p - k * y2;
    y3 = y2 * p + oldy2 * p - k * y3;
    y4 = y3 * p + oldy3 * p - k * y4;
    // clipper band limited sigmoid
    y4 -= (y4 * y4 * y4) / 6;
    oldx = x; oldy1 = y1; oldy2 = y2; oldy3 = y3;
    return y4;
  };
}`}
