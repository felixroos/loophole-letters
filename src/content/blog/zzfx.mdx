# ZZFX

Let's look at [ZZFX](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX), a "Tiny sound generator with 20 controllable parameters", originally developed for size limited games.

The sound generation is very minimal but a very interesting read, which is why I want to pick it apart to better understand it.

This is the whole (minified) code:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
'use strict';let zzfx,zzfxV,zzfxX
// ZzFXMicro - Zuper Zmall Zound Zynth - v1.2.0 by Frank Force ~ 880 bytes
zzfxV=.3    // volume
zzfx=       // play sound
(p=1,k=.05,b=220,e=0,r=0,t=.1,q=0,D=1,u=0,y=0,v=0,z=0,l=0,E=0,A=0,F=0,c=0,w=1,m=
0,B=0,M=Math,R=44100,d=2*M.PI,G=u*=500*d/R/R,C=b*=(1-k+2*k*M.random(k=[]))*d/R,g
=0,H=0,a=0,n=1,I=0,J=0,f=0,x,h)=>{e=R*e+9;m*=R;r*=R;t*=R;c*=R;y*=500*d/R**3;A*=d
/R;v*=d/R;z*=R;l=R*l|0;for(h=e+m+r+t+c|0;a<h;k[a++]=f)++J%(100*F|0)||(f=q?1<q?2<
q?3<q?M.sin((g%d)**3):M.max(M.min(M.tan(g),1),-1):1-(2*g/d%2+2)%2:1-4*M.abs(M.
round(g/d)-g/d):M.sin(g),f=(l?1-B+B*M.sin(d*a/l):1)*(0<f?1:-1)*M.abs(f)**D*zzfxV
*p*(a<e?a/e:a<e+m?1-(a-e)/m*(1-w):a<e+m+r?w:a<h-c?(h-a-c)/t*w:0),f=c?f/2+(c>a?0:
(a<h-c?1:(h-a)/c)*k[a-c|0]/2):f),x=(b+=u+=y)*M.cos(A*H++),g+=x-x*E*(1-1E9*(M.sin
(a)+1)%2),n&&++n>z&&(b+=v,C+=v,n=0),!l||++I%l||(b=C,u=G,n||=1);p=zzfxX.
createBuffer(1,h,R);p.getChannelData(0).set(k);b=zzfxX.createBufferSource();b.
buffer=p;b.connect(zzfxX.destination);b.start();return b};zzfxX=new AudioContext;
```

You can copy paste that code into the browser console! Then copy run this in the console afterwards:

<ZZFX
  params={[
    1.02, 0.05, 336, 0.03, 0.14, 0.3, 2, 1.78, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.6, 0,
    0.31, 0.15, 0.07,
  ]}
  client:only="react"
/>

Of course, you can also just hit play... That `zzfx` function call is all you need to play a sound with 20 params.

There is a handy [sound design tool](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/) where the resulting code can be copied at the bottom of the page.

Some more examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ZZFX params={[
  1,.05,252,.04,.21,.33,1,.52,9.8,0,0,0,.2,0,0,0,0,.99,.25,0
]} client:only="react"/>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ZZFX params={[
  2.03,.05,687,.01,.1,.4,1,1.34,0,0,0,0,.12,0,0,.1,.14,.61,.13,.14
]} client:only="react"/>

## Params

The general idea is to turn the list of params into a list of samples. The params are:

```plaintext
volume
randomness
frequency
attack
sustain
release
shape
shapeCurve
slide
deltaSlide
pitchJump
pitchJumpTime
repeatTime
noise
modulation
bitCrush
delay
sustainVolume
decay
tremolo
```

Instead of just pasting the whole code, let's try to build the function from scratch.

## Buffers

Before we make sounds, let's quickly talk about buffers.
A buffer is just a list of samples, which are amplitude values between -1 and 1.
In the end, it controls how the speaker moves when the buffer is passed to the DAC (digital to analog converter).
The value 0 corresponds to the resting position, -1 and 1 are the outer extremes.
How many samples are played per seconds depends on the sampleRate, which is typically 44100Hz (sometimes 48000Hz).
For example, a buffer containing 44100 numbers will last 1 second with a sample rate of 44,1kHz.

## First Beep

Let's generate a sine wave:

<BufferPlayer value="({i}) => sin(i/20)" client:only />

The text field above defines an expression that is evaluated for each sample number `i`.
The length is only 0.2 seconds or 0.2\*44100 = 8820 samples. It is so short to let our eyes see each sample.

To generate the list of samples, we can do

```js
let ac = new AudioContext();
let seconds = 0.2;
let samples = Array.from({ length: ac.sampleRate * seconds }, (_, i) =>
  fn({ i })
);
```

... where `fn` is the function we define in the input field. The object will be of use later..

To turn that list of samples into sound, we have to use the Web Audio API:

```js
const buffer = ac.createBuffer(1, samples.length, ac.sampleRate);
const source = ac.createBufferSource();

buffer.getChannelData(0).set(samples); // write samples to buffer
source.buffer = buffer; // assign buffer to buffersource
source.connect(ac.destination); // connect source to output
source.start(); // play!
```

## Frequency

We can implement the first param: frequency.
It works like this:

<BufferPlayer value="({i}) => sin(220 * i/sampleRate * PI2)" client:only />

1. `sin(n * PI2)` gives us the beginning of each sine wave cycle for whole numbers of n
2. `i/sampleRate` scales the sample number to seconds
3. so `sin(i/sampleRate * PI2)` would give use a 1Hz sine wave
4. then we just multiply by the desired frequency

To not repeat the above calculation all the time, let's add a new param called `t = frequency * i/sampleRate * PI2` to our function:

<BufferPlayer value="({t}) => sin(t)" client:only />

Let's stick to 220 for out frequency for now.

## Wave Shapes

Instead of a sine wave, we can also use other shapes. This is how ZZFX is calculating the saw:

<BufferPlayer
  value={`({t}) => 1 - (((((2 * t) / PI2) % 2) + 2) % 2)`}
  client:only
/>

... and the triangle:

<BufferPlayer
  value={`({t}) => 1 - 4 * abs(round(t / PI2) - t / PI2)`}
  client:only
/>

... and the tan:

<BufferPlayer
  value={`({t}) => Math.max(Math.min(Math.tan(t), 1), -1)`}
  client:only
/>

... and noise:

<BufferPlayer value={`({t}) => Math.sin((t % PI2) ** 3)`} client:only />

### Shape Curve

The waveform can be shaped liek this:

<BufferPlayer
  value={`({t}) => {
  let shapeCurve = 2;
  let s = 1 - (((((2 * t) / PI2) % 2) + 2) % 2);
  return sign(s) * abs(s) ** shapeCurve;
}`}
  client:only
/>

- 0 gives a square wave
- 1 keeps it as is
- \>1 makes it increasingly more pointy

### Envelope

The envelope controls the volume over time.
Let's start with a simple AD envelope:

<BufferPlayer
  value={`let attack = 0.1 * sampleRate;
let decay = 0.1 * sampleRate;
({ i, t }) => {
  let v;
  if (i < attack) {
    v = i / attack;
  } else if (i < attack + decay) {
    v = 1 - (i - attack) / decay;
  } else {
    v = 0;
  }
  return Math.sin(t) * v;
}`}
  client:only
/>

Full envelope:

<BufferPlayer
  value={`let attack = 0.1 * sampleRate;
let decay = 0.1 * sampleRate;
let sustain = 0.1 * sampleRate;
let release = 0.1 * sampleRate;
let sustainVolume = .8;
let delay = .1;
let length = (attack + decay + sustain + release + delay) | 0;
({ i, t }) => {
  const v = i < attack
    ? i / attack // attack
    : i < attack + decay // decay
    ? 1 - ((i - attack) / decay) * (1 - sustainVolume) // decay falloff
    : i < attack + decay + sustain // sustain
    ? sustainVolume // sustain volume
    : i < length - delay // release
    ? ((length - i - delay) / release) * // release falloff
      sustainVolume // release volume
    : 0; // post release
    return Math.sin(t) \* v;
}`}
  seconds={0.5}
  client:only
/>

Delay does not do anything yet, but it is important to consider here too..

### Pitch Slide

Let's continue with pitch sliding, because it'll reveal a problem with our little frequency calculation.

<BufferPlayer
  value={`let f = 220;
({i}) => {
  f+=0.01;
  return sin(f * i/sampleRate * PI2)
}
`}
  client:only
/>

## Worklets

Below is a WIP for a "live coding" Audio Worklet, where you can write a function that runs for every sample,
which is similar to how [bytebeat](https://greggman.com/downloads/examples/html5bytebeat/html5bytebeat.html) works.

<Worklet
  value={`
function sample({ s,h,r,i,p }) {
  return (s.p+=r*110)%1 / 10;
}
`}
  client:only
/>
variables:

- s = `this` of audio worklet
- h = 1Hz in radians
- r = inverse sample rate / 1Hz in samples
- i = block sample number (0 - 128)
- p = getter for params (not used atm)

## ByteBeat

This is a neat transition to bytebeat, which is a simplified version of the above approach..
Here is a simple bytebeat editor that prerenders a sample of 10s:

<ByteBeat value={`((t >> 10) & 42) * t`} client:only />
<ByteBeat
  value={`// ryg 2011-10-10
((t*("36364689"[t>>13&7]&15))/12&128)+(((((t>>12)^(t>>12)-2)%11*t)/4|t>>13)&127)`}
  hz={8000}
  client:only
/>

<ByteBeat  value={`// Fractalized Past
// by: lhphr
// from: https://dollchan.net/btb/res/3.html#69

(t>>10^t>>11)%5*((t>>14&3^t>>15&1)+1)*t%99+((3+(t>>14&3)-(t>>16&1))/3\*t%99&64)`}
client:only

/>
