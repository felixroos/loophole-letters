Last time, I was getting into generating buffers by hand to do synthesis.
This approach is good to learn the basics of sample manipulation, but one obvious limitation is that it does not run in real time,
as each buffer is pregenerated for a specified number of seconds and then played back.

To recap, a single buffer source can be created like this:

```js
function getBufferSource(ac, length, fn) {
  const samples = new Float32Array(length);
  for (let i = 0; i < samples.length; i++) {
    samples[i] = fn(i); // call fn on each sample
  }
  const buffer = ac.createBuffer(1, samples.length, ac.sampleRate);
  buffer.getChannelData(0).set(samples);
  const source = ac.createBufferSource();
  source.buffer = buffer;
  source.connect(ac.destination);
  return source;
}
```

...which can be used like this:

```js
document.addEventListener("click", function handleClick() {
  const ac = new AudioContext();
  const seconds = 2;
  const source = getBufferSource(ac, ac.sampleRate * seconds, (i) =>
    Math.sin(i / 20)
  );
  source.start();
  document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
});
```

You can copy the above snippet to your browser console + hit enter + click into the page to hear a sine tone.

It would be nice if we could repeatedly regenerate buffers to create endless streams of audio.

Let's solve this problem in a very naive way first..

## Temporal Recursion

First, we need an endless loop:

```js
function timesink(fn, duration = 1000) {
  let block = 0;
  function sink() {
    fn(block++) && setTimeout(sink, duration);
  }
  sink();
}
```

The above snippet implements a simple temporal recursion, where the function passed to timesink is called repeatedly.
When the function returns false, the recursion stops. This is just a more fancy way to do `setInterval`.
Let's use it:

```js
timesink((block) => {
  console.log("block", block);
  return block <= 5;
});
```

If you copy the above snippet, your console should log the block numbers accordingly..

## Buffer Chaining

Using the loop, we can then chain multple buffer together like this:

```js
document.addEventListener("click", function handleClick() {
  const ac = new AudioContext();
  const seconds = 1;
  let phase = 0,
    playhead = ac.currentTime + 0.1,
    frequency = 220;
  timesink((block) => {
    const source = getBufferSource(ac, ac.sampleRate * seconds, (i) => {
      const out = Math.sin(phase) / 8;
      frequency += 0.001;
      phase += (2 * Math.PI * frequency) / ac.sampleRate;
      return out;
    });
    playhead < ac.currentTime && console.log("TOO LATE...");
    source.start(playhead);
    playhead += source.buffer.duration;
    return block < 10;
  }, seconds * 1000);

  document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
});
```

- The `phase` makes sure the next buffer's sine wave phase starts where the previous one left off.
- The `playhead` variable makes sure the next buffer starts exactly where the last one left off.

If you let that run for a while, you might get `TOO LATE...` logged to the console, because the timeout clock is not synced to the audio context clock...

We **could** solve that problem by replacing `timesink` with the "Tale of 2 Clocks" scheduling mechanism from an earlier post:

<details>
<summary>show code</summary>

```js
// generalized "Tale of 2 Clocks" scheduling
function createClock(
  getTime,
  callback, // called slightly before each cycle
  duration = 0.05, // duration of each cycle
  interval = 0.1, // interval between callbacks
  overlap = 0.1 // overlap between callbacks
) {
  let tick = 0; // counts callbacks
  let phase = 0; // next callback time
  let precision = 10 ** 4; // used to round phase
  let minLatency = 0.01;
  const setDuration = (setter) => (duration = setter(duration));
  overlap = overlap || interval / 2;
  const onTick = () => {
    const t = getTime();
    const lookahead = t + interval + overlap; // the time window for this tick
    if (phase === 0) {
      phase = t + minLatency;
    }
    // callback as long as we're inside the lookahead
    while (phase < lookahead) {
      phase = Math.round(phase * precision) / precision;
      phase >= t && callback(phase, duration, tick);
      phase < t && console.log("TOO LATE", phase); // what if latency is added from outside?
      phase += duration; // increment phase by duration
      tick++;
    }
  };
  let intervalID;
  const start = () => {
    clear(); // just in case start was called more than once
    onTick();
    intervalID = setInterval(onTick, interval * 1000);
  };
  const clear = () => intervalID !== undefined && clearInterval(intervalID);
  const pause = () => clear();
  const stop = () => {
    tick = 0;
    phase = 0;
    clear();
  };
  const getPhase = () => phase;
  // setCallback
  return {
    setDuration,
    start,
    stop,
    pause,
    duration,
    interval,
    getPhase,
    minLatency,
  };
}

// clock specific for AudioContext
function getClock(ac, fn, interval) {
  const getTime = () => ac.currentTime;
  const clock = createClock(
    getTime,
    // called slightly before each cycle
    fn,
    interval // duration of each cycle
  );
  return clock;
}
```

</details>

The clock can be used like that:

```js
document.addEventListener("click", function handleClick() {
  const ac = new AudioContext();
  let phase = 0,
    frequency = 220,
    playhead = 0,
    latency = 0.2;
  const clock = getClock(ac, (t) => {
    const source = getBufferSource(ac, ac.sampleRate * clock.duration, () => {
      const out = Math.sin(phase) / 8;
      frequency += 0.0001;
      phase += (2 * Math.PI * frequency) / ac.sampleRate;
      return out;
    });
    playhead = playhead || ac.currentTime + latency;
    source.start(playhead);
    playhead += source.buffer.duration;
    source.stop(playhead);
  });
  clock.start();
  setTimeout(() => {
    clock.stop();
  }, 10000);
  document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
});
```

Again, you can copy that to your console to hear 10 seconds of a hopefully crackle-free rising sine tone.

import { BufferChain } from "../../components/buffers/BufferChain";
